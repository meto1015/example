TO DOs

wit.ai
Concept for chatbot:
	What intents?
	How many intents?
	Expressions
	Entities


nodeJs server
	prettify (clean up the fucking mess of code!!)
	error handling - what if there is no intent detected? --> server will crash so far

	next step: don't just return the intent.. make a concept of handeling the different intents detected
		e.g.	intent = get_teperature
				--> action = return temperature in engelberg

	sendText function has to wait for dispatch intent function! Right now it only works fo the second and ongoing messages and will return the intent of the previous one.
